// Admin-related models
//
// TaxonomyStaging model REMOVED (ML15-290)
//
// Rationale: Taxonomies are treated as code (Infrastructure-as-Code), not database data.
// The staging table created a database dependency that defeated the original static-file
// performance strategy, causing:
// - 28-second queries with 10K+ line JSONB records
// - Massive egress quota consumption (98% usage)
// - Database dependency during Supabase maintenance windows
//
// New workflow: Direct Git commits to `datasets` branch → PR review → merge to `main`
// This follows industry best practices (Netlify CMS, Contentlayer, Keystatic) and leverages
// GitHub's native PR workflow for review/approval instead of custom database staging.
